1. Rest API: The controller sends POST/GET/PATCH requests to update or get data from Model.
2. DOM: The controller gets user interaction and data using DOM(Document Object Model).
3. SSE: The server sent event is used to implement the ~observer pattern~. The clients subscribe to SSE(Server Sent Event) endpoint and whenever data changes, the server notifies all observers/clients.
